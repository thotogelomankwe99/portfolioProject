        <p>
            Hi, I’m Thotogelo Mankwe, a passionate and driven aspiring software developer currently enrolled in a Full Stack C# Software Development Learnership at GirlCode. <br> I’m enthusiastic about using technology to solve real-world problems and contribute meaningfully to the digital transformation driven by the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Through GirlCode, I’m gaining hands-on experience in front-end and back-end development, including technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, .NET, and SQL. <br>I thrive in collaborative environments, love continuous learning, and enjoy sharpening my problem-solving skills. Outside of tech, I challenge myself with chess and quizzes, and I’m always eager to grow both personally and professionally in the ever-evolving IT landscape.
